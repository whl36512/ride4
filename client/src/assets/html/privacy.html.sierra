<h1 class="h3">Sierra Trading Post Privacy Notice</h1>
                <p class="lead">This policy will be effective starting December 11, 2018</p>
                <p>Welcome to <strong>ride.beegrove.com</strong> (the "Website"), the website for 
<strong>Coltony Corporation</strong>. 
This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect about our 
customers on our Website, through our mobile applications, and through interest-based online advertising. 
The Privacy Notice also describes how we may use that information, how we protect that information, 
how we share that information, your choices and options regarding the information
, and how you can contact us regarding our privacy practices.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect certain personal information from you in connection with your activities at Sierra Trading Post, such
                    as when you shop on our Website, through our catalogs, in our stores, or on our mobile applications. This information
                    may include: </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Payment card or other financial account information; </li>
                    <li>contact and billing information (including name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number); </li>
                    <li>driver's license number, military identification or state-issued picture identification;</li>
                    <li>date of birth; </li>
                    <li>geolocation data; and</li>
                    <li>other personal information you provide to us on our Website, through our catalogs, in our stores, on our mobile applications,
                        or when you interact with us in other ways, both online and offline. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additionally, we or companies acting on our behalf may collect certain computer and browser information through automated
                    technologies such as cookies and web beacons when you visit our Website or download or use one of our mobile applications.
                    A "cookie" is a file that a website sends to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to identify
                    the browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel
                    tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected
                    through cookies back to a web server. </p>
                <p>The information collected using these tools may include your IP address, browser characteristics, operating system, the
                    address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits, the language your system
                    uses, and the country and time zone in which your device is located. These automated technologies also permit the
                    collection of "clickstream data," which may include a log of content you access while browsing a website. </p>
                <p>Companies acting on our behalf may combine the information collected from your visit to our Website with other information
                    they have collected previously. Your web browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of
                    cookies and how to restrict, reject or disable certain cookies. </p>
                <h2 class="h4">Interest-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics</h2>
                <p>This section of our Privacy Notice provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called "targeted advertising",
                    “remarketing”, or "behavioral advertising"), Google Analytics, and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.</p>
                <p>We use Google Analytics’ 3rd-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understanding the behavior
                    of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising
                    targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites
                    because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have
                    collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These
                    companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and
                    manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
                <p>You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements
                    tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
                    Advertising at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" title="about ads">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>        and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/"
                        title="google.com">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>. Because those opt-out and preference control pages
                    are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because that page is not operated by the TJX Businesses,
                    we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>When we collect information from you, we may use it for a number of purposes, including to:</p>
                <ul class="list">

                <p>We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.</p>
                <p>In addition, we use information collected online through automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users'
                    visits to our Website and mobile applications; (ii) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users'
                    interests and the manner in which our users browse our Website and mobile applications; (iii) measuring and managing
                    the advertising effectiveness of our online and offline advertisements and events; and (iv) managing our business.
                    We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our Website and mobile applications,
                    identify users of our Website and mobile applications, and gather demographic information about our users. We use
                    clickstream data to determine how much time users spend on web pages of our websites, how users navigate through
                    our websites, and how we may tailor our websites to better meet the needs of our users. In order for us to maintain
                    the accuracy of your personal information and improve our communication with you, we may also supplement the information
                    we collect with other public demographic information.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Information We Share</h2>
                <p>We may share your personal information among the TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including Derailed,

                    and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this statement. Your information may also be transferred
                    as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of a reorganization, dissolution
                    or liquidation) involving all or part of the TJX Businesses or as part of a stock sale or other change in corporate
                    control.</p>
                <p>We may share your name and mailing address with other businesses if you are on our paper-catalogue mailing list, unless
                    you have requested that we not share this information. You may ask us not to share your name and address from our
                    mailing list with these businesses, or ask to be removed from our catalogue mailing list, by contacting us as specified
                    in the "<a href="#contact">Contact Information</a>" section.</p>
                <p>If a contest, sweepstakes or promotion is jointly-sponsored by us and one or more other sponsors, your information may
                    be shared with such sponsors. We do not control other sponsors' use of your personal information, and their use of
                    your information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to
                    be shared in this manner, you may choose not to participate in such jointly sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions.
                    Such offerings may also be subject to additional rules and regulations governing your participation.</p>
                <p>We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with partners or third parties who perform services
                    for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, we may use third
                    parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes,
                    contests or other promotions, conduct customer research, authorize and process your payments, manage and analyze
                    data and our advertising effectiveness, and fulfill gift card orders. Such third-party service providers are given
                    the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose
                    your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.</p>
                <p>We also may share the information you provide (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) with law
                    enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or loss,
                    or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Links</h2>

                    from TJX and may have their own privacy notices or policies. Other linked websites may be owned or controlled by
                    TJX but have privacy policies that differ from this one. To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned
                    or controlled by TJX, we are not responsible for the websites' content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices
                    of the websites. We suggest you review the privacy policies of any linked websites you visit.</p>

                    receive e-mail or postal mail from other members of the TJX Businesses if they received your e-mail or postal address
                    from other sources or as a result of their own transactions or experiences with you, or if you request to hear from

                <h2 class="h4">Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
                <p>If you are a California resident, California law provides that you be given the opportunity to opt out of our sharing
                    your personal information with third parties that would use such personal information for their own direct marketing.
                    Absent such an opt-out, we may share your information with other TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX,
                    including Derailed, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods), to provide you with information about their products, services
                    or promotions that we think may be of interest to you. We also may share your information with other non-affiliates
                    absent such an opt-out, as described in the "Information We Share" section above. Accordingly, per California law,
                    we provide a way for you to opt out if you do not want us to share your information in this manner.</p>
                <p>If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your personal information with certain of our
                    affiliates and other third parties for their marketing purposes. Please tell us your preference by contacting
                    <a href="/lp2/customer-service/">Customer Service</a>. If you have already received communications from us, it will expedite the opt-out process if
                        you are prepared to provide us with the exact name, e-mail and/or postal mail addresses under which you have
                        been receiving communications from us. Please note that it may take us up to 30 days to fully process your opt-out
                        request. </p>
