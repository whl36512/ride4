REPORTING EARNINGS FROM OPEN RIDE
All drivers are considered users of the XYZ ABC platform, monies earned using XYZ ABC are in fact motoring costs reimbursed at the Federal approved motoring rate of $0.565 cents per mile, therefore you are not required to report on this in your tax submissions. If you are in doubt please contact an Independent Tax Advisor.

Legal ridesharing
XYZ ABC is protected by USA Public Law 112-141 (MAP 21 Section 1501) passed in 2012, which defines qualified "real-time ridesharing" programs. The IRS sets the allowable limit for deductible mileage, if used for business or commuting purposes, and that amount is currently $0.56 per mile (currently IRS has no separate cost factor for electric vehicles). XYZ ABC mileage rates are fixed for all riders and drivers, and tiers down from $0.20 as a method to equitably share the cost of a journey, assuming 2-3 persons per car. All XYZ ABC pilots are funding by the Federal Highway Administration, and include participation from the State level Department of Transportation, and the County level Transportation Authority. The purpose of the rider fee is NOT for the driver to make a profit, but rather to automate the human behavior of "chipping in" for gas at the end of the week, or month, between carpool buddies. Finally, any driver can provide a FREE trip to any rider.
